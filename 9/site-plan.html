        <p>
            To my mind Noto Serif' Font will look very elegant as a Heading Font for
            the Beaty Salon Website as this. It is easy to read and it contrast very
            well with the Paragraph font that has an absence of serifs.

            For the Paragraph Font I have chosen "Trebuchet MS", Helvetica as it is
