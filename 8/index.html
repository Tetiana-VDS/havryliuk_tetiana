                <p class="home-paragraph-1">
                    We believe that there is nothing like a river trip for relaxing
                    phisicaly and in mind. That is why we subscribe to the Dry Oar
                    philosophy of boating. Keeping your oars dry for us means taking
                    time to look around and notice the beauty that surrounds the rivers
                    we love. Breathtaking views and company of friends will make your
                    experience unforgettable.

                <h2 class="home-headline-2">Adrenaline Rush</h2>
                <p class="home-paragraph-2">
                    That completely doesn't mean we don't also like rapids. Opposites in
                    all things after all. We believe that that tenseness that comes
                    along when you are turning, and twisting and rushing, and looking
                    down the tongue of a big string of waves makes you appreciate a lot
                    the calm beautiful water and peaceful feelings that always follows
                    even more.
